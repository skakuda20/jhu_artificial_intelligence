    "Artificial Intelligence courses traditionally used Lisp as their programming language of choice and although some courses across the world still do, it isn't nearly as popular as it once was. \n",
    "Lisp has a few interesting features. \n",
    "First, it is a functional language. \n",
    "Second, it views code as data and data as code (a feature known as *homoiconicity*). \n",
    "Third, it offered a meta programming feature called \"macros\" that made the language very flexible. Long before Domain Specific Languages (DSL) became hip, \"Lispers\" were writing programs composed entirely of DSLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of all of Lisp's features, homoiconicity was probably the one most critical to *symbolic* AI. \n",
    "In a field focusing on theorem provers and game playing, the ability to represent both programs and knowledge identically was the proverbial \"killer feature\".\n",
    "Programs could manipulate programs and data could become programs.\n",
    "But they were by no means hardcore Haskellesque functional programmers, often wantonly mutating global variables (so denoted by their \"earmuffs\": `*temperature*`). \n",
    "Almost nobody encourages the use of global variables anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the fortunes of *numeric* AI waxed, the fortunes of *symbolic* AI waned.\n",
    "Because in many people's minds the fates of AI and Lisp were bound together, Lisp suffered a similar fate, becoming somewhat of a niche language...at least that's the perception.\n",
    "In reality, Lisp and its variants have been chuggling along in the background.\n",
    "However as computational power has increased in the last decades, many of the concepts developed in the early days of computer science are reappearing (Some have actually observed that *everything* in computer science was actually invented before 1970, just waiting for the increased computational power).\n",
    "\n",
    "And certainly one of those early ideas is *functional* programming, which is making quite a comeback. \n",
    "The last decade or so has seen the emergence of Haskell, Elixir, F#, Clojure, Scala and other functional programming languages. \n",
    "Traditional languages either have or are adding functional programming features (Java now has anonymous functions or *lambdas*). \n",

    "## Functional Programming\n",
    "[index](#index)\n",
    "\n",
    "When I think of Functional Programming, several things come to mind although these are not universally true of all functional programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Functions are first class values, independent of Classes or Types.\n",
    "2. Data modeling with generic data structures: lists, sets, dictionaries, tuples instead of Classes.\n",
    "3. Operations such as iteration are replaced with higher level oft repeated abstractions such as map, filter and reduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often *immutable* data structures are included in this list. \n",
    "We'll see about that. \n",
    "Most of the built-in collections in Python are *mutable* (except for Tuples) and while there are libraries to inject *immutable* versions of the standard data structures, we might not go quite that far.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a higher level, we can say the Functional Programming approach constructs programs by building up small easily testable *pure* functions into a domain specific language (DSL) for the problem at hand called by *impure* functions at the edges of the program. \n",
    "A **pure function** operates only on its formal arguments, returning a value (there would be no reason for a pure function to return *nothing*). \n",
    "They are extremely easy to reason about and test. \n",
    "An **impure function**, on the other hand, interacts with the outside world in some way: a database, http request, http post, or collecting input from the terminal. \n",
    "They generally require some kind of external setup to test. \n",
    "They can be difficult to reason about: did the function fail because it isn't written correctly or because the API endpoint is down or changed?\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions, both pure and impure, can be assembled in a top-down (start with the main entry function) or bottom-up (start with the lowest level pieces) fashion. \n",
    "Gerald Sussman in *The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* called the top-down approach \"programming by wishful thinking\". \n",
    "You start writing the code calling functions to do the work as if those functions existed in the language.\n",
    "And then you write them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative, the bottom up approach, involves looking at the problem and indentifying the most basic operations you want to perform and then write functions that do those operations.\n",
    "You then start assembling those basic operations into more complex functions.\n",
    "Repeat until you're done.\n",
    "You can do both, though, meeting in the middle at a solution.\n",
    "If this seems abstract to you, there will be examples later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone taking this course should know Python but we're going to quickly review it anyway. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Unless specifically overidden in this document, you should follow [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) stylistic conventions in all your code submissions.**"

In Ruby, `if` is an expression, you can assign the result to a variable:\n",

This is why the namespaces of Java are littered with things like `CommandExecutor`, `PersonFactory` and other such nonsense. Java requires functions to belong to classes, that is, you can only have *methods*.\n",

    "There are a few things to note here. First, for whatever reason, languages get associated with conventions and the naming convention of arguments and variables in Java is \"camelCase\". In Python, it is \"snake_case\". These conventions are often spelled out. In the case of Python, the conventions are documented in [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).  **You are to follow the PEP 8 conventions for all submissions in this course unless specifically overruled. Failure to do so is a failing submission.**\n",

The only slightly interesting method is the `getFullName` method because it does actual work with the values or state of a Person object. But the most important part is `this`. What is `this`? (Note that the PEP-8 convention is to use `self` instead of `this` but I use `this` for consistency.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the Python version for further insight:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(this, first_name, last_name):\n",
    "        this.first_name = first_name\n",
    "        this.last_name = last_name\n",
    "    def set_first_name(this, first_name):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, `this` makes an appearance everywhere. Unlike Java, however, `this` makes an appearance in the method definitions. This was a conscious design decision on van Rossum's part. The *lack* of `this` in method definitions in Java is syntactic sugar. (It is actually a common error to forget to include `this` as a first argument in a method definition. If you see an error that says `f takes 2 arguments, 3 arguments given`, you have most likely made this mistake).\n",

However, when used in conjuction with the other libraries, it gives you a powerful functional programming language that includes macros.\n",
