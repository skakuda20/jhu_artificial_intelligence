    "# Unification\n",
    "\n",
    "This is actually Part I of a two part assignment. In a later module, you'll implement a Forward Planner. In order to do that, however, you need to have a unifier. It is important to note that you *only* need to implement a unifier. Although the module talked about resolution, you do not need to implement anything like \"standardizing apart\". From the unifier's point of view, that should already have been done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unification is simply the *syntactic* balancing of expressions. There are only 3 kinds of expressions: constants, lists and (logic) variables. Constants and lists are only equal to each other if they're exactly the same thing or can be made to be the same thing by *binding* a value to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It really is that simple...expressions must be literally the same (identical) except if one or the other (or both) has a variable in that \"spot\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## S-Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "With that out of the way, we need a language with which to express our constants, variables and predicates and that language will be based on s-expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**constants** - There are two types of constants, values and predicates. Values should start with an uppercase letter. Fred is a constant value, so is Barney and Food. Predicates are named using lowercase letters. loves is a predicate and so is hates. This is only a convention. Secret: your code does not need to treat these two types of constants differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**variables** - these are named using lowercase letters but always start with a question mark. ?x is a variable and so is ?yum. This is not a convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**expressions (lists)** - these use the S-expression syntax a la LISP. (loves Fred Wilma) is an expression as is (friend-of Barney Fred) and (loves ?x ?y).\n",
