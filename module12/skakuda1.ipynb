    "## k Nearest Neighbors and Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this programming assignment you will use k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) to build a \"model\" that will estimate the compressive strength of various types of concrete. This assignment has several objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement the kNN algorithm with k=9. Remember...the data + distance function is the model in kNN. In addition to asserts that unit test your code, you should \"test drive\" the model, showing output that a non-technical person could interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You are going to compare the kNN model above against the baseline model described in the course notes (the mean of the training set's target variable). You should use **10 fold cross validation** and Mean Squared Error (MSE):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$MSE = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum^n_i (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "as the evaluation metric (\"error\"). Refer to the course notes for the format your output should take. Don't forget a discussion of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. use validation curves to tune a *hyperparameter* of the model. \n",
    "In this case, the hyperparameter is *k*, the number of neighbors. Don't forget a discussion of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. evaluate the *generalization error* of the new model.\n",
    "Because you may have just created a new, better model, you need a sense of its generalization error, calculate that. Again, what would you like to see as output here? Refer to the course notes. Don't forget a discussion of the results. Did the new model do better than either model in Q2?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. pick one of the \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the \"course notes\" for from Module 2 for the evaluation portion of the assignment.\n",
    "Anytime you just need test/train split, use fold index 0 for the test set and the remainder as the training set.\n",
    "Discuss any results."
